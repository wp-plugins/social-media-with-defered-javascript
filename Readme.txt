== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work on Thesis? =

Yes this plugin has been tested on Thesis 1.8.4 as I use Thesis myself.

= Does this plugin work on versions prior to 3.0 =

I have not tested on version below 3.0 as you should be updating wordpress periodically for security reasons and to gain the extra functionality that comes with updates.

= Does this plugin work on every theme? =

That is a difficult one to say for sure, the only way for me to know if through feedback as I don't own all themes. But if it works on Thesis and several generic themes then it should be ok.
